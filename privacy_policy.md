# PRIVACY POLICY
Welcome to In-The-Stars’ Privacy Policy. Thank you for reading it.
This policy applies to websites, apps, and services operated by Happlie (Happlie.com). For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “Service”, “Us”, “We” in this Privacy Policy. This policy may change over time to enhance the safety of your information. This policy's goal is to make sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it and how it is used. We want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices before using our services.

## 1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Information you provide us
You choose to provide us with certain information when using our services/browsing our services. This includes:
•	When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials. For example, Facebook login or Phone number.
•	When you use or log in to our service, you provide us with at least your nickname. You can share additional information with us, such as your interest and gender. Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, for example, your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation, and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.
•	When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with your debit or credit card number or other financial information.
•	When you participate in surveys, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions.
•	If you contact our customer service team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions to ensure a high quality of service.
•	We process the content you publish as well as your chats with other users, as part of the operation of the services.
Information we receive from others
We receive information about you from others, including:
•	Social Media
You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log in to your In-The-Stars account. This allows you to share some information from your social media account with us.
•	Other Users
Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For example, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you.
•	Other Partners
We may receive information about you from our partners, for example where In-The-Stars ads are published on a partner’s websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success).
Information collected when you use our services
When you use our services, we collect information about which features you have used, how you have used them, and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details:
•	Usage Information
We collect information about your activity on our services, for example, how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you have been using, searches, clicks, and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your interaction, number of messages you send and receive).
•	Device information
We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including:
o	hardware and software information, such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and apps settings, app crashes, advertising IDs, browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies, or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address)
o	information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider
•	Other Information with your consent
o	If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, including GPS or Wi-Fi connections. if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection, the collection may occur in the background even when you are not using the services. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it.
## 2. COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES

We use and may allow our partners to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s). We may use Cookie in a different situation, such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analysing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features. You can better control their use through your browser settings and other tools.
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including In-The-Stars, do not currently respond to DNT signals.
## 3. HOW WE USE INFORMATION
The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services. Additionally, we use your information to keep you safe and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you.

For example, we analyse users’ behaviour on our services to continuously improve our products or services, we suggest offers we think might interest you, and we process information for administrative, fraud detection, and other legal purposes.
## 4. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION
Since In-The-Stars’ goal is to help you make more connections, the main sharing of users’ information is with other users. In some circumstances, we will share parts of the information with the legal entity. The following are the situations in which we share information with different parties
•	With other users
When you log into our service, you voluntarily disclose your nickname on the Service. You may also disclose more information such as gender and interest. You may also share more information with other users directly through chat or messages. Please be careful with your information since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it.
•	With our service providers and partners
We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. These third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer help, marketing, advertising, payment processing, and security operations.
We may also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services. For example, we may share limited information on you in hashed form with advertising partners. We follow a strict vetting process before engaging any service provider or working with any partner. All our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.
•	When required by law
We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government/law enforcement investigation, or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.
•	To enforce legal rights
We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and the legal rights of our users, business partners, or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.
## 5. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.
We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage, and processing practices to update our physical, technical, and organizational security measures.
If we suspect or detect any breach of security, we may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice.
## 6. YOUR RIGHTS
We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:
•	Access / Update tools in the service. Tools and account settings that help you to access or delete information that you provided to us and that’s associated with your account directly within the service. If you have any questions on those tools and settings, please contact our support team at Hello@Happlie.com
•	Device permissions. Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as location services as well as push notifications. You can change your settings on your device to either consent to or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.
•	Deletion. You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.
•	Uninstall. You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier from your previous transactions and activities.
## 7. HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION
We keep your personal information only if we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable law. In practice, we delete or anonymise your information upon deletion of your account, unless:
1.	We must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some “traffic data” is kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention obligations);
2.	We must keep it to evidence of our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy, and other similar consents are kept for seven years);
3.	There is an outstanding issue, claim, or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or
4.	The information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behaviour or security incidents from opening a new account.
Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical constraints.
## 8. PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES
This policy may change over time without notifying you in advance. The revised policy applies on the day of publishment and replaces the previous policy. We want you to read our policy regularly and understand our privacy practices.
